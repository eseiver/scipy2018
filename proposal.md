## Title: Text and data mining scientific articles with allofplos

## Abstract
allofplos is a Python package for maintaining an always up-to-date set of all 227,000+ scientific articles published by the Public Library of Science (PLOS) and parsing them along a number of dimensions.
This talk will cover the JATS XML standard for scientific publishing, how to use allofplos to iterate through articles and common metadata fields, and how to construct more complex XML queries with XPath.
